# Automated Pipeline

This document outlines the automated pipeline for this project.

## 1. Code Commit

When a developer commits code to the repository, a webhook triggers the CI/CD pipeline.

## 2. Build and Test

The pipeline checks out the code, builds the project, and runs all tests.

## 3. Deployment

If the build and tests are successful, the pipeline deploys the application to the staging environment.

## 4. Production Release

After successful testing in the staging environment, the release is manually promoted to production.
