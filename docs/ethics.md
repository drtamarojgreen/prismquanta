# AI Ethics and Bias Mitigation in PrismQuanta

## Our Commitment

PrismQuanta is committed to the responsible development and deployment of AI. We recognize that language models can perpetuate and even amplify existing societal biases. We are dedicated to proactively identifying and mitigating these biases to ensure our AI is fair, ethical, and safe for all users.


## Enhanced Ethics and Bias System

Our comprehensive approach to AI ethics and bias mitigation has been significantly enhanced and includes the following key components:

### 1. Advanced Multi-Method Bias Detection

Our enhanced ethics system employs multiple detection methods:

#### Pattern-Based Detection
- **Explicit bias patterns:** Direct detection of stereotypical language and discriminatory statements
- **Implicit bias detection:** Contextual analysis to identify subtle biases and coded language
- **Intersectional bias detection:** Recognition of compound discrimination affecting multiple identity categories

#### Bias Categories Covered
*   **Gender bias:** Stereotypical language related to gender roles, capabilities, and attributes
*   **Racial and ethnic bias:** Harmful stereotypes, cultural appropriation, and racial profiling language
*   **Ageism:** Age-based stereotypes and capability assumptions for both older and younger individuals
*   **Ableism:** Discrimination against individuals with disabilities, including problematic language and assumptions
*   **Socioeconomic bias:** Class-based stereotypes and educational discrimination
*   **Religious bias:** Religious stereotypes and discriminatory language
*   **Intersectional bias:** Recognition of how multiple identity factors compound bias effects
*   **Microaggressions:** Detection of subtle discriminatory language and backhanded compliments

### 2. Integrated Pipeline Processing

#### Enhanced Task Manager
- **Real-time ethics checking:** Every AI output is automatically screened before acceptance
- **Bias mitigation prompting:** Automatic generation of corrective prompts when violations are detected
- **Retry mechanism:** Up to 3 attempts to generate compliant output with progressive mitigation
- **Configurable thresholds:** Adjustable severity thresholds for different deployment contexts

#### Enforcement Actions
- **Flag for review:** Non-critical violations are logged and flagged for human review
- **Immediate timeout:** Critical violations trigger immediate AI timeout and manual intervention
- **Mitigation prompting:** Automatic generation of bias-corrective prompts
- **Comprehensive logging:** All violations are logged with timestamps, severity scores, and mitigation attempts

### 3. Severity-Based Response System

#### Severity Levels
- **Low (1-3 points):** Minor language issues, warnings logged
- **Medium (4-6 points):** Moderate bias, mitigation prompting triggered
- **High (7-10 points):** Significant bias, immediate flagging and retry required
- **Critical (11+ points):** Severe violations, immediate timeout and manual review

#### Scoring Algorithm
- Racial/gender stereotypes: 10 points
- Implicit bias and coded language: 7 points
- Ageism and ableism: 5 points
- Other bias types: 3 points
- Intersectional bias: Compound scoring

### 4. Comprehensive Testing Framework

#### BDD Test Coverage
- **Ethics detection tests:** Comprehensive scenarios covering all bias types
- **Pipeline integration tests:** End-to-end testing of ethics integration
- **Mitigation effectiveness tests:** Validation of bias correction mechanisms
- **Performance impact tests:** Monitoring of ethics checking overhead

#### Test Categories
- Gender bias detection and mitigation
- Racial bias and coded language detection
- Intersectional bias recognition
- Severity threshold enforcement
- JSON output validation
- Pipeline integration scenarios

### 5. Advanced Mitigation Strategies

#### Targeted Mitigation
- **Gender-neutral language:** Prompts for inclusive language when gender bias is detected
- **Cultural sensitivity:** Education on cultural awareness and respect
- **Age-inclusive language:** Guidance on avoiding age-based assumptions
- **Person-first language:** Correction of ableist language patterns
- **Intersectionality awareness:** Recognition of compound identity effects

#### Mitigation Prompt Generation
- Context-aware correction instructions
- Specific guidance based on violation type
- Preservation of original task intent
- Progressive escalation for persistent violations

### 6. Monitoring and Reporting

#### Comprehensive Logging
- Timestamped violation records
- Severity scoring and categorization
- Mitigation attempt tracking
- Success/failure rate monitoring

#### Analytics and Reporting
- Violation trend analysis
- Mitigation effectiveness metrics
- Performance impact assessment
- Compliance rate reporting

### 7. Configuration and Customization

#### Configurable Parameters
- Bias severity thresholds
- Maximum retry attempts
- Strict vs. lenient ethics modes
- Custom bias pattern definitions

#### Deployment Flexibility
- Development vs. production configurations
- Industry-specific bias pattern sets
- Regulatory compliance adaptations

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Ethics Bias Checker (`scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh`)**
   - Standalone bias detection and analysis tool
   - JSON output for integration
   - Configurable pattern matching
   - Severity scoring and mitigation suggestions

2. **Enhanced Task Manager (`scripts/enhanced_task_manager.sh`)**
   - Integrated ethics checking in AI pipeline
   - Automatic mitigation and retry logic
   - Configurable enforcement policies
   - Comprehensive violation logging

3. **BDD Test Suite**
   - Comprehensive test coverage for all bias types
   - Pipeline integration testing
   - Automated test execution and reporting

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Ethics Checking
```bash
# Check text for bias violations
./scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh --text "Your text here" --json

# Check file content
./scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh --file input.txt
```

#### Enhanced Task Processing
```bash
# Run with strict ethics mode
./scripts/enhanced_task_manager.sh --ethics-strict

# Set custom bias threshold
./scripts/enhanced_task_manager.sh --bias-threshold 8
```

#### BDD Testing
```bash
# Run all ethics tests
cd tests/bdd && ./enhanced_test_runner.sh

# Run specific test categories
./enhanced_test_runner.sh --filter "ethics"
```
