# AI Ethics and Bias Mitigation in PrismQuanta

## Our Commitment

PrismQuanta is committed to the responsible development and deployment of AI. We recognize that language models can perpetuate and even amplify existing societal biases. We are dedicated to proactively identifying and mitigating these biases to ensure our AI is fair, ethical, and safe for all users.

## Our Approach

Our approach to AI ethics and bias mitigation is multi-faceted and includes the following key components:

### 1. Rule-Based Bias Detection

We are developing a set of rules to detect and flag potentially biased or unethical language in the LLM's output. These rules are designed to identify a wide range of biases, including but not limited to:

*   **Gender bias:** Stereotypical language related to gender roles and attributes.
*   **Racial and ethnic bias:** Harmful stereotypes or generalizations about race and ethnicity.
*   **Ageism:** Negative stereotypes or discrimination based on age.
*   **Ableism:** Discrimination or prejudice against individuals with disabilities.
*   **Other forms of bias:** We are continuously researching and adding new rules to address other forms of bias as they are identified.

### 2. Continuous Monitoring and Polling

We will implement a continuous monitoring system that will periodically poll the LLM's output and run it against our bias detection rules. This will allow us to identify and address issues in near real-time.

### 3. Consequence Management

When a potential bias or ethical violation is detected, our system will take one or more of the following actions:

*   **Flag the output:** The output will be flagged for human review.
*   **Re-prompt the LLM:** The LLM will be re-prompted with a modified version of the original input that is designed to elicit a more neutral and unbiased response.
*   **Log the violation:** The violation will be logged for further analysis and to help us improve our bias detection rules.

### 4. Transparency and Accountability

We are committed to being transparent about our efforts to mitigate bias. We will publish our bias detection rules and regularly report on our progress in this area. We also welcome feedback from the community on how we can improve our approach.
