# Reward System Configuration for PrismQuanta
#
# This file defines positive reinforcement mechanisms for successful
# task completion and desired behaviors. The system uses this to
# encourage optimal performance and learning.
#
# Format: <reward_id>|<trigger_condition>|<reward_action>|<reward_value>
#
# Reward IDs should be unique identifiers
# Trigger conditions describe what earns the reward
# Reward actions define what positive reinforcement to apply
# Reward values indicate the magnitude/importance (1-100)
