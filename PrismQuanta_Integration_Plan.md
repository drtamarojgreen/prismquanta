# PrismQuanta Integration Plan

This document outlines a plan for integrating the various repositories of the PrismQuanta ecosystem.

## 1. Project Architecture

The PrismQuanta ecosystem is a comprehensive framework for developing and operating autonomous AI agents. It is composed of a variety of components, each with a specific role. The components can be categorized as follows:

**Core System:**
*   `quanta_porto`: The central control system.
*   `quanta_sensa`: An autonomous agent framework.

**Agent Modules (Specialized Functions):**
*   `quanta_ethos`: Ethical framework.
*   `quanta_dorsa`: Neuroscientific modeling pipeline.
*   `quanta_cogno`: Mental health and genomics API.

**Monitoring and Safety:**
*   `quanta_quilida`: Quality control and verification.
*   `quanta_alarma`: Real-time anomaly and risk alerts.
*   `quanta_pulsa`: Real-time performance and hallucination detection.

**Task Management:**
*   `quanta_serene`: Conflict resolution and scheduling.
*   `quanta_lista`: High-level task management and coordination.

**Developer Tools:**
*   `quanta_occipita`: PowerShell module bootstrapper.
*   `quanta_memora`: Advanced C++ project template generator.

**Visualization:**
*   `quanta_retina`: ASCII graph renderer.
*   `quanta_cerebra`: ASCII video generator for brain activity.
*   `alignment_map`: Interactive genomic data visualizer.
*   `multiple_viewer`: Interactive graph data visualizer.

**Knowledge Management:**
*   `quanta_glia`: Manages the entire ecosystem of repositories.

## 2. Integration Strategy

The integration of the PrismQuanta ecosystem will require a multi-faceted approach.

### 2.1. Communication Protocols

A standardized communication protocol is needed for the various components to interact with each other. Given that many of the components are C++ applications that expose a RESTful API, a REST-based architecture is a natural choice. A central message broker, such as RabbitMQ or ZeroMQ, could also be used for asynchronous communication between agents.

### 2.2. Build System

For the C++ components, a unified build system is recommended. CMake is already used by several of the repositories, and it is a good choice for a cross-platform build system. A top-level CMakeLists.txt file could be created to manage the builds of all the C++ components.

### 2.3. Multi-Language Support

The ecosystem uses a variety of languages (C++, Python, PowerShell, R). The integration strategy must account for this. The C++ components can be built as libraries or executables. The Python components can be run as standalone scripts or integrated with the C++ components using tools like Pybind11. The PowerShell and R scripts can be executed from the C++ or Python components.

### 2.4. Visualization Tools

The visualization tools are mostly Windows-specific console applications. To integrate them into the larger Linux-based ecosystem, they would need to be re-written using a cross-platform GUI framework (e.g., Qt, Dear ImGui), or they could be run in a Windows virtual machine.

## 3. Development Roadmap

A possible roadmap for the development of the PrismQuanta ecosystem is as follows:

**Phase 1: Core System**
1.  Develop `quanta_porto` into a fully functional central controller.
2.  Develop `quanta_sensa` into a robust autonomous agent framework.
3.  Integrate `quanta_porto` and `quanta_sensa`.

**Phase 2: Essential Modules**
1.  Develop `quanta_ethos` to provide a basic ethical framework.
2.  Develop `quanta_serene` and `quanta_lista` to provide task management capabilities.
3.  Integrate these modules with the core system.

**Phase 3: Advanced Modules**
1.  Develop the more specialized agent modules, such as `quanta_dorsa` and `quanta_cogno`.
2.  Develop the monitoring and safety components, such as `quanta_quilida`, `quanta_alarma`, and `quanta_pulsa`.
3.  Integrate these modules into the ecosystem.

**Phase 4: Tools and Visualization**
1.  Develop the developer tools, such as `quanta_occipita` and `quanta_memora`.
2.  Develop the visualization tools, making them cross-platform.
3.  Develop `quanta_glia` to manage the entire ecosystem.

## 4. Conclusion

The PrismQuanta ecosystem is a complex and ambitious project. A phased and modular approach to its development and integration will be essential for its success. This document provides a high-level plan for how this can be achieved.
