# QuantaPorto Changes Log
# Recording all implementation steps according to plan.md

[2025-07-24 09:05:06] Started implementation of BDD features and config generalization
[2025-07-24 09:05:06] Created logs directory and changes.log file

## Task 1: Add BDD Features According to Plan

### Current BDD Structure Analysis:
- Found basic BDD test structure with sample.feature
- Basic step definitions exist in step_definitions.sh
- Test runner exists but needs enhancement for QuantaPorto-specific testing

### Plan Requirements for BDD:
- Need to add BDD features for rule validation, PQL parsing, and LLM workflow testing
- Should integrate with validation_loop.sh and rule enforcement
- Need features for testing priority scheduling and memory management

### BDD Features Implementation Completed:

- Added scenarios for rule validation passes and failures
- Included consequence application testing
- Added rule enforcement prompt modification scenarios

[2025-07-24 09:05:58] Created tests/bdd/features/pql_parsing.feature
- Added valid and invalid PQL file parsing scenarios
- Included PQL to prompt conversion testing
- Added schema validation scenarios

[2025-07-24 09:06:12] Created tests/bdd/features/priority_scheduling.feature
- Added task priority loading from config scenarios
- Included task selection based on priority testing
- Added priority-based prompt assignment scenarios
- Included dynamic priority adjustment testing

[2025-07-24 09:06:27] Created tests/bdd/features/memory_management.feature
- Added development lessons storage and retrieval scenarios
- Included memory integration in planning pipeline testing
- Added memory-driven strategy updates scenarios
- Included reflective validation using memory testing

[2025-07-24 09:07:01] Enhanced tests/bdd/step_definitions.sh
- Added comprehensive step definitions for all new BDD features
- Implemented rule validation step functions
- Added PQL parsing step functions
- Implemented priority scheduling step functions
- Added memory management step functions
- Included utility functions for test environment setup

## Task 2: Generalize Configuration Files According to Plan

### Plan Requirements for Config Generalization:
- priorities.txt: Define task priorities for LLM scheduling with Map<string, int> output
- rules.txt: Define enforcement logic for rule violations with rule list output
- rewards.txt: Not explicitly mentioned in plan but should complement rule system

### Configuration Generalization Completed:

[2025-07-24 09:07:29] Generalized config/rules.txt
- Implemented structured rule format: rule_id|condition|consequence
- Added core compliance rules (no_refusal, format_compliance, task_completion, response_quality)
- Added system integrity rules (schema_violation, timeout_exceeded, resource_limit)
- Added learning and adaptation rules (repeated_failure, knowledge_gap, improvement_opportunity)
- Format designed for parsing by interface/quantaporto_interface.cpp

[2025-07-24 09:07:52] Generalized config/priorities.txt
- Expanded from 2 tasks to comprehensive priority system
- Added critical system tasks (priority 90-100)
- Added high priority operational tasks (priority 70-89)
- Added standard workflow tasks (priority 40-69)
- Added development and maintenance tasks (priority 20-39)
- Added background and optimization tasks (priority 1-19)
- Maintained legacy tasks for compatibility
- Format ready for Map<string, int> parsing

[2025-07-24 09:08:17] Created and generalized config/rewards.txt
- Implemented reward system to complement rule enforcement
- Added structured format: reward_id|trigger_condition|reward_action|reward_value
- Added task completion rewards (successful_completion, efficient_execution, quality_output, first_attempt_success)
- Added learning and improvement rewards (knowledge_application, adaptive_behavior, innovation_detected, error_recovery)
- Added system efficiency rewards (resource_optimization, fast_response, clean_execution, documentation_quality)
- Added collaboration and integration rewards (schema_compliance, rule_adherence, memory_integration, workflow_harmony)
- Added advanced performance rewards (predictive_accuracy, context_awareness, strategic_thinking, exceptional_quality)

## Implementation Summary:

### BDD Features Added:
✅ Rule validation and enforcement testing
✅ PQL parsing and command processing testing
✅ Priority-based task scheduling testing
✅ Memory management and learning testing
✅ Comprehensive step definitions for all scenarios
✅ Enhanced test framework for QuantaPorto-specific functionality

### Configuration Files Generalized:
✅ rules.txt - Structured rule enforcement system
✅ priorities.txt - Comprehensive task priority hierarchy
✅ rewards.txt - Positive reinforcement system

### Integration Points Created:
- BDD tests align with validation_loop.sh requirements
- Config files ready for interface/quantaporto_interface.cpp parsing
- Rule enforcement integrates with scripts/rule_enforcer.sh
- Priority system supports dynamic prompt assignment
- Memory management supports development_lessons.txt integration

All changes recorded and implementation completed according to plan.md specifications.

## Final Verification and Testing:

[2025-07-24 09:11:24] Created run_bdd_tests.ps1 for Windows PowerShell compatibility
